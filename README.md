# circularityOS
I'm working on designing a launcher/custom skin of android and linux!
I've always enjoyed the feel of iOS, MacOS & Linux, due to the streamlined user experience of these operating systems.
Android has always been tempting due to the level of tinkering one can do to the overall feel of the OS, and how truly custom the ux can become.
However, the current state of android's heavy reliance on google for most of its functionality has kept me pretty distant from migratign to the platform.
The goal of this project is to provide the same level of interoperability that apple and samsung have achieved within their ecosystems, without the need to provide an extensive amount of user data.
circularityOS will allow for smartphones, wearables, computers (desktop and laptop class PCS), tablets, and other IoT devices to communicate with one another over WiFi and Bluetooth protocols in ways that feel frictionless,
i.e. universal clipboard on iPhone/iPad/Mac & Samsung's Galaxy Products, while maintaining universal compatibility with other android devices at the user's discretion.
circularityOS, at the end of the day, is AOSP with a different design ethos than what google has leaned into in recent years
The goal is to also ensure total user privacy, providing the user with extensive controls over what kind of data is shared when making a "circularity account", making sure that users get access to connected experiences without harvesting extensive amounts
of personally identifiable information (PII).
The level of privacy I hope for this project to achieve is inspired by Proton's privacy practices.
They are the framework with which I wish to ensure this launcher for android & distro for linux align themselves with, allowing for users to make one account to use across their devices and other services,
all while upholding their privacy.
